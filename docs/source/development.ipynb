    "# Development\n",
    "\n",
    "We welcome contributions to XRADIO from the radio astronomy community and beyond! If you want to participate in the development of the library, please join us on [GitHub](https://github.com/casangi/xradio) - we welcome issue reports and pull requests!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setting up a Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install the conda environment manager from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and create a clean, self-contained runtime where XRADIO and all its dependencies can be installed:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name xradio python=3.13 --no-default-packages\n",
    "conda activate xradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "> 📝 On macOS, if one wants to use the functions to convert MSv2=>MSv4, it is required to pre-install `python-casacore` . This can be done using `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore`. See more alternatives below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clone XRADIO repository, move into directory and install: \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/casangi/xradio.git\n",
    "cd xradio\n",
    "pip install -e \".[all]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `-e` (or `--editable`) is a convenient option that ensures that the installation location is the same as the cloned repository (using `pip list` should show this), so that you can directly modify the cloned repo and have those modifications reflect directly in the development environment. The `[all]` ensures that all dependencies so that you can run tests, the interactive Jupyter notebooks and build the documentation (the dependencies can be found in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/pyproject.toml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the documentation navigate to the docs folder, create a folder name build and run sphix:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd docs\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "sphinx-build source build -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Submitting Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any code you submit is under the [BSDv3 license](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and you will have to agree with our [contributor license agreement](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSING_AGREEMENT.txt) that protects you and the XRADIO project from liability.\n",
    "- Create an issue on github outlining what you would to contribute [XRADIO GitHub repository](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/issues).\n",
    "- Once there is agreement on the scope of the contribution you can create a branch on github or in you clones repository:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "  git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "(If you create the branch in your cloned repository remember to link it to the GitHub issue).\n",
    "- Make your code changes and add unit tests.\n",
    "- Run the tests locally using [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).\n",
    "- After running [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) add, commit and push your code changes to the GitHub branch:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "  git add -u :/ #This will add all changed files.\n",
    "  git commit -m 'A summary description of your changes.'\n",
    "  git pull origin main #Make sure you have all the latest changes in main.\n",
    "  git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If you are making many changes you can break up the work into multiple commits.\n",
    "- If tests pass and you are satisfied open a pull request in GitHub. This will be reviewed by a member of the XRADIO team."

    "## Code Organisation\n",
    "\n",
    "Each data schema supported by XRADIO is organized into its own sub-package, with a shared `_utils` directory that contains code common to multiple sub-packages as shown in Figure 1. The current architecture includes the `measurement_set` and `image` sub-packages ([see the list of planned XRADIO schemas](overview.ipynb#Dataset-types)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The user-facing API is implemented in the `.py` files located at the top level of each sub-package directory, while private functions are housed in a dedicated sub-directory, such as `_measurement_set`. This sub-directory contains folders for each supported storage backend, as well as a `_utils` folder for common functions used across backends.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the `measurement_set` sub-package, XRADIO currently supports a `zarr`-based backend. Additionally, we offer limited support for `casacore` table Measurement Set v2 (`MS v2`), through a conversion function that allows users to convert data from Measurement Set v2 (stored in Casacore tables) to Measurement Set v4 (stored using zarr). The conversion function for MS v2 requires the optional dependency `python-casacore`, or alternatively CASA's `casatools` backend (see [casatools I/O backend](measurement_set/guides/backends.md)).\n",

    "\n",
    "## Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO is built using the following core packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `xarray`: Provides the a framework of labelled multi-dimensional arrays for defining and implementing data schemas.\n",
    "- `dask` and `distributed`: Enable parallel execution for handling large datasets efficiently.\n",
    "- `zarr` (zarr specification, [v2](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2/v2.0.html) and [v3](https://zarr-specs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs.html)): Used as a storage backend for scalable, chunked and compressed n-dimensional data.\n",
    "- Optionally, [python-casacore](https://github.com/casacore/python-casacore) ([Casacore Table Data System (CTDS) File Formats](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/260.pdf)): Used to convert data from MS v2 to MS v4 in Zarr format, with ongoing development toward a lightweight, pure Python replacement. Alternatively, the [casatools I/O backend](measurement_set/guides/backends.md) can be used.\n",
    "- Optionally, [pyasdm](https://github.com/casangi/pyasdm) (under development): A Python-based storage backend in progress, designed for accessing ASDM (Astronomy Science Data Model) data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "All data is organized into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [xarray Datasets](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html): A multi-dimensional, in-memory, array database of labeled n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- [xarray DataTrees](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/hierarchical-data.html): a hierarchical representation of multiple heterogeneous datasets, used in particular to group collections of `xarray Datasets`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating an Xarray-based schema, we use the following conventions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coordinates**: Values used to label plots and index data (e.g., numbers or strings). Data arrays that are coordinates are always **eagerly** loaded under the assumption that it will be required for indexing operations. Coordinate names are always in lowercase `snake_case`.\n",
    "- **Data Variables**: Numerical values used for processing and plotting. Data is **lazily** loaded if possible, as it might be too large to load speculatively. Data variable names always use uppercase `SNAKE_CASE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, in the [Measurement Set v4 schema](measurement_set/schema.rst), `antenna_name` and `frequency` are coordinates, while `VISIBILITY` data are data variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Processing Sets` are XRADIO implementation of xarray DataTree objects that consist of a collection of nodes that represent `Measurement Sets` as xarray DataTree objects. Each `Measurement Set` is a DataTree that groups a collection of `xarray Datasets`. Among these datasets are the `correlated` dataset (either `Spectrum` or `Visibilities` dataset), the `antenna` dataset, the `field_and_source` dataset, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lazy and Eager Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions prefixed with `open_` perform **lazy execution**, meaning only metadata—such as coordinates and attributes—are loaded into memory. Data variables, though not immediately loaded, are represented as lazy [Dask Arrays](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/generated/dask.array.Array.html). These arrays only load data into memory when you explicitly call the `.compute()`, `.load()` or related methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions prefixed with `load_` perform **eager execution**, loading all data into memory immediately. These functions can be integrated with [dask.delayed](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/delayed.html) for more flexible execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Coding Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatting**: All code should be formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). A GitHub Action will trigger on every push and pull request to check if the code has been correctly formatted.\n",
    "- **Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "  - Use descriptive names. For example, use `image_size` instead of `imsize`.\n",
    "  - Function names and variables should follow snake_case. Examples: `my_function`, `my_variable`.\n",
    "  - Class names should follow CamelCase. Example: `MyClass`.\n",
    "- **Imports**: Avoid relative imports; always use absolute imports to maintain clarity.\n",
    "- **Docstrings**: All functions and classes should include NumPy-style docstrings. For guidelines, refer to the [NumPy Documentation Guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).\n",
    "- **Compute-Intensive Code**: Ensure that compute-intensive code is vectorized for performance. If vectorization is not feasible, consider using [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba). Use performance testing to verify that optimizations are effective.\n",
    "- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all major functions and classes using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). The folder structure of `xradio/tests/unit` should mirror the source code structure.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Logging**: Use the [toolviper](https://github.com/casangi/toolviper/blob/main/docs/graphviper-logger-formatting-example.ipynb) logger for consistent logging."

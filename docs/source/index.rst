XRADIO - Xarray Radio Astronomy Data I/O
========================================

XRADIO (Xarray Radio Astronomy Data I/O) makes working with radio astronomy data in Python simple, efficient, and fun!

XRADIO implements the **Measurement Set v4.0.0** schema, designed for storing radio interferometer and single-dish telescope data for offline processing. Other schemas are being developed.

For a general overview of XRADIO and the schemas included in it, see the section :doc:`Overview <overview>` (it is recommended to pay special attention to the Foundational Reading subsection).
More information on XRADIO development can be found in the section :doc:`Development <development>`.
The Measurement Set v4 is described in the section :doc:`Measurement Set v4.0.0 <measurement_set_overview>`.

    "# Measurement Set Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial notebook can be run on the Google Colaboratory environment via this [link](https://colab.research.google.com/github/casangi/xradio/blob/main/docs/source/measurement_set/tutorials/measurement_set_tutorial.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "**XRADIO** is an open-source Python package that leverages [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to provide an interface for radio astronomy data. It includes converters for legacy formats and defines versioned schemas for each dataset type. A schema checker is also included to verify whether a dataset conforms to the expected schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is organized into the following structures:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [xarray.Dataset](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html): A multi-dimensional, in-memory array container for labeled n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- [xarray.DataArray](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html): An n-dimensional array with labeled coordinates and dimensions.\n",
    "- [xarray.DataTree](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.DataTree.html): A tree-like hierarchical collection of xarray objects (datasets and children trees).\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO extends the functionality of these xarray data structures by making use of **xarray accessors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use XRADIO effectively, it's important to understand the terminology and indexing methods used in xarray. The following documentation is recommended reading:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [xarray terminology](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/terminology.html)\n",
    "- [xarray data structures](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/data-structures.html) (arrays, coordinates, datasets, and data trees)\n",
    "- [xarray indexing and selection guide](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/user-guide/indexing.html)\n",

    "## Measurement Set v4 Schema Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "The Measurement Set v4 (MSv4) schema for radio telescope interferometric data (*Visibilities*) and single-dish data (*Spectrum*) is implemented in memory as an [`xarray.DataTree`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.DataTree.html). \n",
    "\n",
    "The root node of this data tree (the measurement set `xarray.DataTree`, `ms_xdt`), is the `cor_xds` (correlated `xarray.Dataset`), which contains the Visibility or Spectrum data. It also includes data that shares the same dimensions as the Visibility/Spectrum data and serves a similar role to the *Main* table in Measurement Set v2 (MSv2).\n",
    "\n",
    "The child nodes of `ms_xdt` contain metadata such as antenna positions, field and source definitions, and other auxiliary information. Each `ms_xdt` is limited to a single observation, spectral window, polarization setup, observation mode, processor, and beam per antenna.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple `ms_xdt` trees can be grouped together as children of a processing set data tree (`ps_xdt`). This tree has an empty root node, with each child node representing an individual `ms_xdt`. The design of `ps_xdt` is inspired by the [Multi-MS format](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/v6.2.0/notebooks/parallel-processing.html#The-Multi-MS) in MSv2.\n",
    "\n",
    "Figure 1 illustrates a simplified comparison between the Processing Set structure in MSv4 and the Multi-MS structure in MSv2. Blocks with the same color indicate similar information content. Blocks in between parenthesis are optional in their respective schemas.\n",

    "A `ps_xdt` (Processing Set DataTree) can be lazily opened using either [`xradio.measurement_set.open_processing_set`](https://casangi.github.io/xradio/api/xradio.measurement_set.html#xradio.measurement_set.open_processing_set) or [`xarray.open_datatree`](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/latest/generated/xarray.open_datatree.html). When lazily opened, none of the data variables within the datasets are immediately loaded into memory. Instead, they are represented by lazy Dask arrays. The `open_processing_set` function provided by `xradio.measurement_set` exists to support future storage formats that are not natively handled by xarray. For example, telescopes such as ALMA and the VLA produce data in the ASDM (Astronomical Science Data Model) format, which may require custom loading and conversion logic. By using `open_processing_set`, XRADIO ensures flexibility and extensibility for supporting complex and evolving data formats beyond the scope of standard xarray I/O. \n",

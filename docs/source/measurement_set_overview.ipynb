    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Measurement Set v4 (MS v4) schema defines how correlated data (interferometer visibilities and single-dish spectra) can be represented in memory using datasets that consist of n-dimensional arrays labeled with coordinates and meta-information contained in attributes (see [foundational reading](overview.ipynb#Foundational-Reading)). The MS v4 implementation differs from the MS v2 implementation in [casacore](https://github.com/casacore/casacore) primarily in its use of Python and off-the-shelf packages for data structures and data serialization, contrasting with `casacore's` bespoke C++ approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference documents consulted for the MS v4 schema design:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [MeasurementSet definition version 2.0](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/229.pdf)\n",
    "- [MeasurementSet definition version 3.0Î²](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/264.pdf)\n",
    "- [MeasurementSet VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry) extensions](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/265.pdf)\n",
    "- [CASA Ephemeris Data](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/external-data.html#Ephemeris-Data)\n",
    "- [ASDM (Astronomy Science Data Model): SDM Tables Short Description](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16a3g0GQxgcO7N_ZabfdtexQ8r2jRbYIS/view)\n",
    "\n",
    "The current MS v4 schema focuses on offline processing capabilities and does not encompass all information present in the ASDM. However, its design allows for future expansion to incorporate additional data as needed (see [schema versioning](overview.ipynb#Schema-Versioning) section). It's important to note that MS v4 is not backward compatible with either MS v2 or MS v3, representing a significant evolution in the data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Schema Layout\n",
    "\n",
    "An xarray dataset conforming to the MSv4 schema contains data for a single observation, spectral window, polarization setup, observation mode, processor and beam per antenna (though finer partitioning, such as splitting by scan, is allowed if desired). This structure simplifies the MS v4 data representation relative to the MS v2, enabling it to be stored as n-dimensional arrays with consistent shapes over time (rare baseline dropouts are handled by NaN padding). Related datasets can be grouped together into a Processing Set (`ps`), which is useful for processing them together. Importantly, each MS v4 is fully self-describing. As shown in [Figure 1](#figure-1) (a simplified diagram; for full details, see the [Data Model Schema](measurement_set/schema_and_api/measurement_set_schema.rst)), the MS v4 is structured as a dataset (xds) of datasets comprising the `correlated_xds` along with `antenna_xds`, `pointing_xds`, `phase_calibration_xds`, `weather_xds`, `system_calibration_xds`, `gain_curve_xds`, and `phased_array_xds`, all stored in the attribute section. The `correlated_xds` contains the `VISIBILITY` (for interferometer data) or `SPECTRUM` (for single dish data), `UVW`, `WEIGHT`, and `FLAGS` data variables, along with info dictionaries in the attributes. The `field_and_source_xds` is specifically stored within the attributes of the `VISIBILITY`/`SPECTRUM` data variable.\n",

    "    </figure>\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Groups \n",
    "\n",
    "The `correlated_xds` can contain multiple copies of `VISIBILITY`/`SPECTRUM`, `UVW`, `WEIGHT`, and `FLAG` data variables. To maintain the relationship between a set of data variables, a `data_group` dictionary is used with fixed lowercase keys: 'correlated_data', 'uvw', 'weight', and 'flag'. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `data_groups` dictionary is stored as an attribute of the main dataset (`ms_xds`) and can contain one or more `data_group`s. Data variables can be shared between `data_group`s or be unique to a specific group. For example, you might have a 'base' group and an 'imaging' group:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Example: ms_xds.attrs['data_groups'] = {\n",
    "   'base': {'correlated_data': 'VISIBILITY', 'flag': 'FLAG', 'weight': 'WEIGHT', 'uvw': 'UVW'}, \n",
    "   'imaging': {'correlated_data': 'VISIBILITY_CORRECTED', 'flag': 'FLAG', 'weight': 'WEIGHT_IMAGING', 'uvw': 'UVW'}\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The 'base' and 'imaging' `data_group`s share the same 'flag' and 'uvw' data variables but have different 'correlated_data' and 'weight' data variables. When creating new versions of data variables, they must contain the standard name followed by an underscore and a description chosen by the developer. For example, a new version of `VISIBILITY` could be `VISIBILITY_PHASE_SHIFTED`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ms_xds` also allows for selecting a `data_group`. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "sub_ms_xds = ms_xds.sel(data_group='imaging')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
    "\n",
    "The MS v4 has been designed to satisfy the following use cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Radio Interferometry \n",
    "- Single Dish Observations\n",
    "- On-the-fly (OTF) Mosaic Observations \n",
    "- Ephemeris Observations \n",
    "- Heterogeneous Antenna VLBI \n",
    "- Phased Array Stations (PAS)\n",
    "- Phased Array Feeds (PAF)\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure that these use cases are met, we have created stakeholder tests that convert MS v2 to MS v4 using the [convert_msv2_to_processing_set](measurement_set/schema_and_api/measurement_set_api.rst#xradio.measurement_set.convert_msv2_to_processing_set) function. These tests cover a wide selection of instruments:\n",

    "## Summary of Key Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "The following changes and deprecations are relative to MS v2. Some of the changes from MS v3 are adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- An MS v4 is fully self-describing and contains the information for a single observation, spectral window, polarization setup, observation mode, processor, and beam per antenna.\n",
    "- Data is stored in Datasets of labeled n-dimensional arrays (called data variables) instead of tables.\n",
    "- The table concept of rows has been replaced by relevant dimensions. For example, the `VISIBILITY` column in the `MAIN table` of MS v2 is now an n-dimensional array with dimensions time x baseline x frequency x polarization (row has been split into time x baseline).\n",
    "- Most keys that used to be implicit numbered indices have been changed to descriptive names. This improves code readability, allows for sub-selecting data without reindexing, and enables easy data combination. For example, `antenna_name` is used instead of `antenna_id`.\n",
    "- The concept of data description (DDI) is deprecated and replaced by `spectral_window_name` and `polarization_setup`.\n",
    "- Versioning of the `VISIBILITY`/`SPECTRUM`, `WEIGHT`, `UVW`, and `FLAG` data variables is done using [data groups](measurement_set_overview.ipynb#Data-Groups).\n",
    "- The [JPL Horizons ephemerides](https://casadocs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/external-data#Ephemeris-Data) was used to create the ephemeris schema instead of the MS v2.\n",
    "- Redefinition of `WEIGHT` to be `WEIGHT_SPECTRUM`. Contemporary interferometers are spectral machines; consequently, weights can be distinctive per channel. The `WEIGHT` data variable has the same shape as the `VISIBILITY`/`SPECTRUM` data variable.\n",
    "- Field, source, and ephemeris data have been combined into a single dataset.\n",
    "- Antenna and feed data have been combined into a single dataset (an MS v4 can only have one feed type per antenna).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deprecation List MS v2\n",
    "\n",
    "- `MAIN Table`\n",
    "    - `WEIGHT_SPECTRUM` (Now called `WEIGHT`).\n",
    "    - `FLAG_CATEGORY`: This has not been used effectively and `FLAG` versioning can now be done with [data groups](measurement_set_overview.ipynb#Data-Groups).\n",
    "    - `FLAG_ROW`: The purpose of `FLAG_ROW` was to avoid having to renumber rows when e.g. removing an antenna. This is not necessary with data variables that are labeled since implicit indices are no longer used.\n",
    "    - `SIGMA`: This is redundant since `WEIGHT` is always considered to be `1/SIGMA^2`.\n",
    "    - `BASELINE_REFERENCE`: This is no longer used in VLBI.\n",
    "- `FIELD Table` \n",
    "    - `FIELD_DELAY_CENTER`: No use case has been found.\n",
    "    - `EPHEMERIS_ID`: Only a single ephemeris dataset per MS v4 is permitted.\n",
    "- `ANTENNA Table`: \n",
    "    - `OFFSET`:  No use case has been found.\n",
    "- `FEED Table`: \n",
    "    - `POL_RESPONSE`, `BEAM_OFFSET`, `POSITION`: Not effectively used and will be replaced by a beam model dataset which is under development.\n",
    "- `POINTING Table`: \n",
    "    - `TARGET`, `SOURCE_OFFSET`, `ON_SOURCE`: Redundant information contained in `field_and_source_xds`.\n",
    "    - `TRACKING`: No use case has been found.\n",

The WSU ASDM is an update of the [ASDM](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PMrZFbkrMVfe57K6AAh1dR1FalS35jP2/view) implementation required by [ALMA WSU](https://science.nrao.edu/facilities/alma/science_sustainability/wideband-sensitivity-upgrade) where the spectral windows are no longer interleaved.

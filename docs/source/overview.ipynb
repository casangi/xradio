    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO is an open-source Python package that leverages [xarray](https://github.com/pydata/xarray) to provide an interface for radio astronomy data. It includes converters from legacy formats and contains versioned schemas for each dataset type. A schema checker is also included to verify if a dataset conforms to the schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data is organized into:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [xarray Datasets](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/generated/xarray.Dataset.html): a multi-dimensional, in-memory container of labeled n-dimensional arrays.\n",
    "- [xarray DataTrees](https://docs.xarray.dev/en/stable/user-guide/hierarchical-data.html): a hierarchical representation of multiple datasets, used in particular to group collections of `xarray Datasets`."

    "## Schema Versioning\n",
    "\n",
    "Each schema in XRADIO follows semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **MAJOR**: Changes to existing dimensions, coordinates, data variables, attributes, or measures. (This will not occur without wider community consultation.)\n",
    "- **MINOR**: Addition of new datasets. (Backward compatible)\n",
    "- **PATCH**: Addition of new coordinates, data variables, attributes, or measures to existing datasets. (Backward compatible)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- v4.0.0 to v5.0.0: Major change in the Measurement Set structure\n",
    "- v4.0.0 to v4.1.0: Addition of a new dataset type\n",
    "- v4.0.0 to v4.0.1: Addition of new attributes to an existing dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "The Measurement Set schema starts at v4.0.0, building upon the work of [Measurement Set V2](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/229.pdf) and [Measurement Set v3](https://casacore.github.io/casacore-notes/264.pdf) (which was never implemented).\n",
    "\n",
    "An XRADIO release will be tied to specific versions of each available schema. All generated data will include both the XRADIO version and the schema version in the attribute section."

    "## Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO can be installed in virtual environments via pip. It is recommended to use the conda environment manager from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) to create a clean, self-contained runtime where XRADIO and all its dependencies can be installed:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name xradio python=3.12 --no-default-packages\n",
    "conda activate xradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "> 📝 On macOS it is required to pre-install `python-casacore` using `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore`.\n",
    "\n",
    "XRADIO can now be installed using:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install xradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will also install the minimal dependencies for XRADIO. Note that if only the minimal dependencies are installed, the functionality to convert MSv2 to MSv4 will not be available. This requires installing `python-casacore` (also included in the `all` group, see below), or alternatively the `casatools` backend, as explained in the [casatools I/O backend guide](measurement_set/guides/backends.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "To install the minimal dependencies and the interactive components (JupyterLab) use:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install \"xradio[interactive]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "To enable conversion from MSv2 to MSv4 use (this only works for Linux): \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install \"xradio[python-casacore]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "To be able to run tests:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install \"xradio[test]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Multiple-dependencies can be installed using:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install \"xradio[interactive,python-casacore,test]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a more complete set of dependencies:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "pip install \"xradio[all]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "This will include the dependencies required to run the interactive Jupyter notebooks, run tests, build documentation, and python-casacore to enable MSv2=>MSv4 functionality. \n"

    "## Contributing\n",
    "\n",
    "We welcome contributions to XRADIO from the radio astronomy community and beyond!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read the XRADIO [Overview](overview.ipynb), [Development](development.ipynb), and the relevant schema section for example [Measurement Set v4.0.0](measurement_set_overview.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Pay special attention to the [Foundational Reading](overview.ipynb#Foundational-Reading) subsection in the Overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Complete the relevant tutorials (for example the [measurement set tutorial](measurement_set/tutorials/index.rst)), which demonstrates the schema and API usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up Development Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "- Install the conda environment manager from [miniforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge) and create a clean, self-contained runtime where XRADIO and all its dependencies can be installed:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "conda create --name xradio python=3.12 --no-default-packages\n",
    "conda activate xradio\n",
    "```\n",
    "> 📝 On macOS, if one wants to use the functions to convert MSv2=>MSv4, it is required to pre-install `python-casacore` . This can be done using `conda install -c conda-forge python-casacore`. See more alternatives below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clone XRADIO repository, move into directory and install: \n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/casangi/xradio.git\n",
    "cd xradio\n",
    "pip install -e \".[all]\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `-e` (or `--editable`) is a convenient option that ensures that the installation location is the same as the cloned repository (using `pip list` should show this), so that you can directly modify the cloned repo and have those modifications reflect directly in the development environment. The `[all]` ensures that all dependencies so that you can run tests, the interactive Jupyter notebooks and build the documentation (the dependencies can be found in the [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/pyproject.toml)).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Building documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "To build the documentation navigate to the docs folder, create a folder name build and run sphix:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "cd docs\n",
    "mkdir build\n",
    "sphinx-build source build -v\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Coding Standards\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Formatting**: All code should be formatted using [Black](https://github.com/psf/black). A GitHub Action will trigger on every push and pull request to check if the code has been correctly formatted.\n",
    "- **Naming Conventions**:\n",
    "  - Use descriptive names. For example, use `image_size` instead of `imsize`.\n",
    "  - Function names and variables should follow snake_case. Examples: `my_function`, `my_variable`.\n",
    "  - Class names should follow CamelCase. Example: `MyClass`.\n",
    "- **Imports**: Avoid relative imports; always use absolute imports to maintain clarity.\n",
    "- **Docstrings**: All functions and classes should include NumPy-style docstrings. For guidelines, refer to the [NumPy Documentation Guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html).\n",
    "- **Compute-Intensive Code**: Ensure that compute-intensive code is vectorized for performance. If vectorization is not feasible, consider using [Numba](https://github.com/numba/numba). Use performance testing to verify that optimizations are effective.\n",
    "- **Testing**: Write unit tests for all major functions and classes using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/). The folder structure of `xradio/tests/unit` should mirror the source code structure.\n",
    "- **Error Handling & Logging**: Use the [toolviper](https://github.com/casangi/toolviper/blob/main/docs/graphviper-logger-formatting-example.ipynb) logger for consistent logging.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Submitting Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Any code you submit is under the [BSDv3 license](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/LICENSE.txt) and you will have to agree with our [contributor license agreement](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/blob/main/CONTRIBUTOR_LICENSING_AGREEMENT.txt) that protects you and the XRADIO project from liability.\n",
    "- Create an issue on github outlining what you would to contribute [XRADIO GitHub repository](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/issues).\n",
    "- Once there is agreement on the scope of the contribution you can create a branch on github or in you clones repository:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "  git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name\n",
    "```\n",
    "(If you create the branch in your cloned repository remember to link it to the GitHub issue).\n",
    "- Make your code changes and add unit tests.\n",
    "- Run the tests locally using [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest).\n",
    "- After running [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) add, commit and push your code changes to the GitHub branch:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "  git add -u :/ #This will add all changed files.\n",
    "  git commit -m 'A summary description of your changes.'\n",
    "  git pull origin main #Make sure you have all the latest changes in main.\n",
    "  git push\n",
    "```\n",
    "- If you are making many changes you can break up the work into multiple commits.\n",
    "- If tests pass and you are satisfied open a pull request in GitHub. This will be reviewed by a member of the XRADIO team."

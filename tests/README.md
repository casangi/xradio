# XRADIO Tests
XRADIO Tests use pytest and are located in the `tests` directory. There are two types of tests:
- Unit Tests: located in `tests/unit`
- stakeholder Tests: located in `tests/stakeholder`

The main documentation for tests is in [xradio.testing](https://github.com/casangi/xradio/src/xradio/testing/README.md).
